      <p>
        Hi, I'm Kareena, a passionate and aspiring web developer currently
        studying at Navgurukul, Delhi, pursuing Advance diploma in Software
        programming. My journey into the world of web development began with a
        strong curiosity and a desire to explore the endless possibilities of
        the digital world. Over the past months, I've dedicated myself to
        learning and mastering essential web technologies. I have a solid
        foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript , Python and Basic C , and I've had
        the opportunity to apply my skills by creating several projects. These
        projects, ranging from Registration page , Home project , Movify project
        , Calculator, have not only allowed me to put my knowledge into practice
        but have also provided valuable hands-on experience in problem-solving
        and creative thinking. My time at Navgurukul has been transformative.
        The supportive learning environment, combined with a focus on real-world
        skills, has empowered me to grow as a developer and a learner. I'm
        excited to continue my education and broaden my skill set as I work
        towards my BCom degree. Beyond the digital realm, I have a passion for
        Reading Psychology facts and Travelling. I believe that a well-rounded
        perspective is essential for innovation and creativity. As a newcomer to
        the tech world, I'm eager to embark on a career in web development,
        collaborate on exciting projects, and contribute to the ever-evolving
        landscape of technology. If you have an opportunity, project, or just
        want to connect and share experiences, please don't hesitate to reach
        out. I'm always open to new challenges and eager to learn. Thank you for
        taking the time to learn a little bit about me. Let's explore the
        digital world together!
